Date 24 - 30 January

This week I was again working on setting up my machine and finishing the courses that had to b completed immediately(cyber security).
Getting access and developer rights for projects I will be working on.

Wednesday
Got to do my first deployment, simple version update and merge, but got to see how the company uses different environments, and uses them to create a pipeline for testing code and data. Also got to do a merge on another project, this time merging into a specific release branch instead of master, showing me how we work in patches, and save past branches for customer support and documentation.

Working through getting permissions for local admin rights and applying to access to the programs necessary for development on the projec.
